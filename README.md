# First Machine Learning Project – Linear Regression

This is my first Machine Learning project where I implemented **Linear Regression using Gradient Descent ** to predict **placement package based on CGPA**.

---

## Problem Statement
To predict the expected placement package of a student based on their CGPA using a supervised machine learning approach.

---

## Dataset
- Feature: CGPA (out of 10)
- Target: Package (in LPA)
- Dataset type: Simple numerical dataset for regression
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayurdalvi/simple-linear-regression-placement-data

---

## Machine Learning Approach
- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Cost Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimization: Gradient Descent
- Parameters learned: Weight (w) and Bias (b)

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## Results
- The model successfully learns the linear relationship between CGPA and package.
- Cost function decreases with iterations, showing proper convergence.

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Python notebook / script
3. Enter CGPA value when prompted
4. Get predicted package

---

## What I Learned
- How gradient descent works mathematically
- Vectorization using NumPy
- Cost function minimization
- Building ML without libraries like sklearn

---

## Future Improvements
- Add more features (skills, internships, projects)
- Use polynomial regression
- Compare with sklearn implementation
